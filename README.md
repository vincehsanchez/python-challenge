### PyBank Instructions
We create a Python script to analyze the financial records of a company with a financial dataset called budget_data.csv.
The dataset is composed of two columns: 
- "Date"
- "Profit/Losses"

We create a Python script that analyzes and calculates each of the following values:
1. Total number of months included in the dataset
1. Net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
1. The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
1. Greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
1. Greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

Finally, our script prints the analysis to the terminal and exports a text file with the results.

Note:


### PyPoll Instructions
We modernize the vote-counting process of a small, rural town with a set of poll data called election_data.csv. 

The dataset is composed of three columns:
- "Voter ID"
- "County"
- "Candidate". 

Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:
1. The total number of votes cast
1. A complete list of candidates who received votes
1. The percentage of votes each candidate won
1. The total number of votes each candidate won
1. The winner of the election based on popular vote

Lastly, our script prints the analysis to the terminal and exports a text file with the results.
